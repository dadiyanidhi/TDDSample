TDD terms: "unit test," "integration test," "E2E," and "test doubles."

A unit test is a test you write to assess the functionality of an independent piece of a program. In other words, a unit test checks if a fully isolated unit of program is working as intended.

An integration test assesses the functionality of a dependent piece of program. In other words, an integration test checks if a program—which depends on other code—is working as intended.

An End-to-End (E2E) test assesses the functionality of a user interface. In other words, E2E checks if your user interface is working as intended.

Test doubles are the imitation objects used to mimic real dependencies like databases, libraries, networks, and APIs.
